题目含义：
Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:

Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
"+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
"D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
"C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.

思路：
用vector存储数字
代码：
class Solution {
public:
    int calPoints(vector<string>& ops) {
        int result = 0;
        vector<int> vec;
        for(int i = 0;i<ops.size();i++){
               if(ops[i] == "+"){
                   result+=vec[vec.size()-1] + vec[vec.size()-2];
                   vec.push_back(vec[vec.size()-1] + vec[vec.size()-2]);
               }else if(ops[i] == "D"){
                   result+=2*vec[vec.size()-1];
                   vec.push_back(2*vec[vec.size()-1]);
               }else if(ops[i] == "C"){
                   result-=vec[vec.size()-1];
                   vec.erase(vec.end()-1);
               }else{
                   vec.push_back(atoi(ops[i].c_str()));
                   result+=atoi(ops[i].c_str());
               }                
            }
                return result;
        }
};
